# Reddit Comments 

The goal of this program is to build a machine learning model to classify comments on a given Reddit comments
page. Using the code to thoroughly communicate through Reddit's API, we can safely construct the model to 
recognize positive and/or negative comments.

# What I learned:
- Implementaion of NLTK(Natural Language Took Kit) for processing natural human language to create tokenizers 
and organize data.
- Understanding Reddit's simple API using PRAW(Python Reddit API Wrapper) which allows easy access to Reddit's
data and storing into variables using Python.
